# Sutherland-Hodgman-Clipping-Algorithm
Implementation of sutherland hodgman clipping algorithm in python

The Sutherlandâ€“Hodgman algorithm is an algorithm used for clipping polygons. It works by extending each line of the convex clip polygon in turn and selecting only vertices from the subject polygon that are on the visible side. 

First enter the number of subject polygon.
Plot that in GUI window.
Again enter the number of points for clip polygon but plot those points in anticlock-wise.
Finally you can see the output after clipping.
